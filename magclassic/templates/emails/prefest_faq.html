<b> Will passes be sold at the door?</b>
Yes. Full three-day passes will be available for $50, and one day passes will be available for $30 for Friday, $30 for Saturday, and $20 for Sunday. Children 5 & under are free, and children 12 & under receive a discount. We do not anticipate selling out, so you should have no problem purchasing a pass at-event.

<b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my pass?</b>
The first step is to go to the registration desk, located in Upper Foyer near the parking garage entrance to pick up your pass. The registration desk is open from 10am - midnight Friday and Saturday, and 10am-1pm Sunday. If you pre-registered, simply show photo id such as a driver's license, military id, or student id to the registration staffers. If you do not have photo id, print out the confirmation e-mail you received when you pre-registered.

<b>Which registration line do I use?</b>
- Attendees who purchased a standard badge should use the "Pre-Registered Badge Pickup" line.
- Attendees who did a group registration, or Marketplace vendors, should use the "Groups & Dealers" line.
- Staff, Supporters, Guests, and Panelists should use the line that lists those categories.
- If you are not already registered for a pass, use the "On-Site Registration" line.

<b>Where can I pick up swag that I pre-ordered, such as a t-shirt or supporter bundle?</b>
After you've picked up your pass, you can pick up your swag at the MAGFest merch booth. The merch booth is located at the base of the escalators.
