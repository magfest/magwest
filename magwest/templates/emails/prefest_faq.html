<br><br>
<b> Will badges be sold at the door?</b>
Yes. Full three-day weekend badges will be available for $80, and one day badges will be available for $45 for Friday, $50 for Saturday, and $25 for Sunday. Children 5 & under are free, and children 12 & under receive a discount equal to half of the current badge price (available for weekend badges only). We may sell out of one day badges at the door, so if you have friends who haven't gotten their MAGWest badge yet, encourage them to grab a weekend badge now and secure their spot.
<br><br>
<b>Where can I park for the weekend?</b>
The Hyatt Regency Santa Clara offers day parking for $15 in the front lot, or for free on the 2nd and 3rd floors of the parking garage located behind the hotel. Overnight parking is $15 per night in either location.
<br><br>
<b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my badge?</b>
The first step is to go to the registration desk located in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency to pick up your badge. The registration desk is open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM Friday and Saturday, and 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM Sunday. If you pre-registered, simply show photo ID such as a driver's license, military ID, or student ID to the registration staffers. If you do not have a photo ID, print out the confirmation e-mail you received when you pre-registered.
<br><br>
<b>Which registration line do I use?</b>
- Attendees who purchased a standard badge should use the "Pre-Registered Badge Pickup" line.
- Staff, Supporters, Guests, and Panelists should use the line that lists those categories.
- If you are not already registered for a badge, you can register on your phone and then join the "Pre-Registered Badge Pickup" line, or head to our handy "At-Door Registration" kiosks first.

<b>Where can I pick up swag that I pre-ordered, such as a t-shirt or supporter bundle?</b>
