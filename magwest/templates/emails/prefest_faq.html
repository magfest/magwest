<b> Will badges be sold at the door?</b>
Yes. Full three-day weekend badges will be available for $75, and one day badges will be available for $35 for Friday, $45 for Saturday, and $20 for Sunday. Children 5 & under are free, and children 12 & under receive a discount equal to half of the current badge price (available for weekend badges only). We may sell out of one day badges at the door, so if you have friends who haven't gotten their MAGWest badge yet, encourage them to grab a weekend badge now and secure their spot.
<br><br>
<b>Where can I park for the weekend?</b>
The Doubletree by Hilton offers day/overnight parking for $18 in their parking lot per day. Parking on the street is not allowed, and parking at the nearby business parks is not allowed for hotel visitors.
<br><br>
<b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my badge?</b>
The first step is to go to the registration desk located near the stairway convention center entrance of the DoubleTree to pick up your badge. The registration desk is open from 9:00 AM to 12:00 AM Friday and Saturday, and 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM Sunday. If you pre-registered, simply show photo ID such as a driver's license, military ID, or student ID to the registration staffers. If you do not have a photo ID, print out the confirmation e-mail you received when you pre-registered.
<br><br>
<b>Where can I pick up swag that I pre-ordered, such as a t-shirt or supporter bundle?</b>
After you've picked up your badge, you can pick up your swag at the MAGWest Merch booth. The merch booth is located within the Marketplace. Consult our schedule for Marketplace/Merch hours.
<br><br>
<b>Am I still able to purchase kick-in swag?</b>
Yes! Quantities are <i>extremely</i> limited, so you'll need to make your way to the MAGWest Merch booth in the Marketplace as soon as possible! If you want to make sure you secure your swag before the event, you can return to your badge info page (see your badge confirmation email) and upgrade your badge.
