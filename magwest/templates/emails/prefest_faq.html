If you are receiving this, you are registered for <a href="http://magwest.org">{{ c.EVENT_NAME }}</a>, occurring September 9th-11th, 2016. This FAQ should answer most of your questions about the event. You may reach us at contact@magwest.org for any questions not covered here.

<b> Will passes be sold at the door?</b>
Yes. Full three-day passes will be available for $50, and one day passes will be available for $30 for Friday, $30 for Saturday, and $20 for Sunday. Children 5 & under are free, and children 12 & under receive a $10 discount. We do not anticipate selling out, so you should have no problem purchasing a pass at-event.

<b>Where can I park for the weekend?</b>
The Mark Center has a garage with parking for $15/day with a voucher, which you can pick up at the Info Desk located at Registration. If the Mark Center's garage fills up (which we expect it to), the parking attendants will direct you to the nearby lot at 4900 Seminary Road. Parking there will be around $25 for Friday, and $10 for Saturday or Sunday.

<b>Where do I go when I arrive? How do I pick up my pass?</b>
The first step is to go to the registration desk, located in the Upper Foyer near the parking garage entrance to pick up your pass. The registration desk is open from 10 AM—10 PM Friday and Saturday, and 10 AM—2 PM Sunday. If you pre-registered, simply show photo ID such as a driver's license, military ID, or student ID to the registration staffers. If you do not have a photo ID, print out the confirmation e-mail you received when you pre-registered.

<b>Which registration line do I use?</b>
- Attendees who purchased a standard badge should use the "Pre-Registered Badge Pickup" line.
- Staff, Supporters, Guests, Panelists, and Dealers should use the line that lists those categories.
- If you are not already registered for a pass, use the "On-Site Registration" line.

<b>Where can I pick up swag that I pre-ordered, such as a t-shirt or supporter bundle?</b>
After you've picked up your pass, you can pick up your swag at the MAGFest merch booth. The merch booth is located at the base of the escalators.
