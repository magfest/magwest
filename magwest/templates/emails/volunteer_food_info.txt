Catered meals will be served at the following times in the Staff Suite (San Martin):
Breakfast: 11:00 am
Dinner: 5:00 pm
These meals are served first-come first-served and in limited quantity.

Snacks, tea, and small meals are available 24/7 in the Tea Room (San Simeon)

{% if attendee.badge_type == ATTENDEE_BADGE %}You will become eligible for food after working your first shift if you have signed up for at least 12 weighted hours. Please visit Staffing Ops (in the Silicon Valley Room across from the 2F ballrooms) after you first get your badge to get your shift schedule, and then come back to get your ribbon marked after working your first shift and getting your department head to sign your sheet. You will not be able to get snacks, drinks, or meals without your volunteer ribbon being properly marked.

{% endif %}The first meal served will be breakfast on Friday morning, and the suite will remain open through Sunday afternoon.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
